## Time tracking and utils

- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) - automatic time tracking when no invocing is needed, integrates with NeoVim
- [Pandan](https://sindresorhus.com/pandan) - minimalistic "time awareness" app (reminds to have a break)
- [iSmartClock](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/ismartclock/id706803884?mt=12) - nice minimalist desktop clock for Mac
