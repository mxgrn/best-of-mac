# My favorite macOS apps

Very opinionated list of best macOS apps. I use these daily, usually after considering and trying out a bunch of alternatives.

## Application Launcher

- [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) - tried so many times to switch over to something else (except for paid Alfred), but always came back; not perfect, but still might be the best

## Time tracking and utils

- [Tyme](https://www.tyme-app.com/en/) - very polished app for tracking time and putting up basic invoices
- [Pandan](https://sindresorhus.com/pandan) - minimalistic "time awareness" app (reminds to have a break)
- [iSmartClock](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/ismartclock/id706803884?mt=12) - nice minimalist desktop clock for Mac

## Terminal

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) - a terminal with a much better macOS support than, say, Alacritty (my previous go-to terminal); check out my [config](https://github.com/mxgrn/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/ghostty/config)

## Automation

- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
- BetterTouchTool (included with [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/bchuvwnh))

## Postgres client

- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) - recently got lots of great new features

## Mail client

- [MailMate](https://freron.com/) - no-BS email client that allows conveniently deleting all messages from the same sender, a time saver

## RSS client

- [ReadKit](https://readkit.app/)

## Personal knowledge base

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Screenshots

- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) (included with [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/bchuvwnh))

## Battery health

- [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) -- prevents battery from charging to 100% (included with [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/bchuvwnh))

## Menu bar

- [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) -- a polished open-source alternative to Bartender (which, beside being a paid app, started crashing way too often)

## Monitoring

- [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) -- open-source menu bar utils to monitor system activity

## Offline Documentation
