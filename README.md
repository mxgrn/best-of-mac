# My favorite macOS apps

Very opinionated list of best macOS apps. I use these daily after considering a bunch of alternatives.

## Time tracking and utils

- [Tyme](https://www.tyme-app.com/en/) - very polished app for tracking time and putting up basic invoices
- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) - automatic time tracking when no invocing is needed, integrates with NeoVim
- [Pandan](https://sindresorhus.com/pandan) - minimalistic "time awareness" app (reminds to have a break)
- [iSmartClock](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/ismartclock/id706803884?mt=12) - nice minimalist desktop clock for Mac

## Terminal

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) - a terminal with a much better macOS support than, say, Alacritty (my previous go-to terminal); check out my [config](https://github.com/mxgrn/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/ghostty/config)

## Automation

- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
- BetterTouchTool

## Postgres client

- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) - recently got lots of great new features

## Mail client

- [MailMate](https://freron.com/) - no-BS email client that allows conveniently deleting all messages from the same sender, a time saver

## RSS client

- [ReadKit](https://readkit.app/)

## Personal knowledge base

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Screenshots

- [Xnip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xnip-screenshot-annotation/id1221250572)

## Battery health

- [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) -- prevents battery from charging to 100%

## Menu bar

- [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) -- a polished open-source alternative to Bartender (which, beside being a paid app, started crashing way too often)

## Monitoring

- [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) -- open-source menu bar utils to monitor system activity
